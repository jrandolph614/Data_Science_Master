This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(openxlsx)
xlsxFile <- system.file("extdata","Test2_Appl_Reg_v3_Data.xlsx", package = "openxlsx")
df <- read.xlsx(xlsxFile = "Test2_Appl_Reg_v3_Data.xlsx", sheet = 1, skipEmptyRows = FALSE)
df
ml <- lm(Y~X1+X2+X3, data=df)
summary(ml)
```
```{r}
library(olsrr)
f1 <- ols_step_forward_p(ml,pent=0.05,progress=TRUE)
b1 <- ols_step_backward_p(ml,prem=0.05)
```
```{r}
f1$model
f1$adjr
# final estimated model with forwards selection is y = a + b2x2
```
```{r}
b1$model
b1$adjr
# final estimated model with backwards selection is y = a + b1x1 + b3x3
```
```{r}
anova(ml)
qf(0.05,1,17,lower.tail = FALSE)
```








Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
