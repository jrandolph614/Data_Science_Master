This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
load("STREETVN.rdata")
mlr <- lm(formula=EARNINGS~AGE+HOURS, data=STREETVN)
pred <- data.frame(AGE=20,HOURS=8 )
predict(mlr,newdata=pred)
summary(mlr)
predict(mlr,newdata=pred, interval = "confidence", level = 0.99)
confint(lm(formula=EARNINGS~HOURS, data=STREETVN))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
