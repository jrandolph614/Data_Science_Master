This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#problem 1
library(openxlsx)
xlsxFile <- system.file("extdata","data-table-B8.xlsx", package = "openxlsx")
df <- read.xlsx(xlsxFile = "data-table-B8.xlsx", sheet = 1, skipEmptyRows = FALSE)
lm <- lm(formula=y~x1+x2, data=df )
print(summary(lm))
lm.stdress <- rstandard(lm)
qqnorm(lm.stdress, ylab="Standardized Residuals",  xlab="Normal Scores", main="Clathrates")
qqline(lm.stdress)
print("b) The graph shows that the distrobution is heavy tailed with above the line in lower percentile and below the line in higer percentile.")
plot(lm)
print("c) The graph is an idea graph with the distribution of points centered arund the line however point 34,35 and 28 seem to be outliers")
df
```
```{r}
library(openxlsx)
xlsxFile <- system.file("extdata","data-table-B10.xlsx", package = "openxlsx")
df <- read.xlsx(xlsxFile = "data-table-B10.xlsx", sheet = 1, skipEmptyRows = FALSE)
lm <- lm(formula=y~x1+x2, data=df )
print(summary(lm))
lm.stdress <- rstandard(lm)
qqnorm(lm.stdress, ylab="Standardized Residuals",  xlab="Normal Scores", main="Clathrates")
qqline(lm.stdress)
print("b) The graph shows an ideal distribution with most of the data fitting to the line.")
plot(lm)
print("c) the graph shows that the relatioship is not linear.")
PRESS <- function(model) {
    i <- residuals(model)/(1 - lm.influence(model)$hat)
    sum(i^2)
}
 res <-PRESS(lm)
 print(res)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
